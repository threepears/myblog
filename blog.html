      <p>Harrison Ford broke his leg on the set, but he is an old, tough bastard so will live.  Which is good.  If it had been George Lucas, I wouldn't have cared if he lived.....just sayin'.</p>

        <p>Well...today is <time>October 6, 2015</time>, so we're still a couple months off.  Therefore, I suggest we all enter induced comas and remain there until we can awaken at the premiere, so that time will pass more quickly and we won't have to wait as long.</p>
